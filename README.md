# Predictive-Analytics.Py
## Overview

Welcome to **PredictiveAnalyticsPy**! This repository contains a collection of machine learning models and tools for predictive analytics using Python. Our focus is on creating easy-to-use and efficient predictive models for various types of data.

## Features

- **Regression Models**: Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression.
- **Classification Models**: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
- **Time Series Forecasting**: ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet.
- **Clustering Models**: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Scaling, Encoding, Imputation.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

## Installation

To get started with **PredictiveAnalyticsPy**, you need to have Python 3.x installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to set up the repository:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PredictiveAnalyticsPy.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
    ```sh
    cd PredictiveAnalyticsPy
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Here is a basic example of how to use a regression model from this repository:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from predictive_analytics.regression import LinearRegressionModel

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('data/sample_data.csv')
X = data[['feature1', 'feature2']]
y = data['target']

# Initialize and train the model
model = LinearRegressionModel()
model.train(X, y)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X)
print(predictions)
```
