## Installation

To get started with **PredictiveAnalyticsPy**, you need to have Python 3.x installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to set up the repository:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/data-manavpatil/PredictiveAnalyticsPy.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
    ```sh
    cd PredictiveAnalyticsPy
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Here is a basic example of how to use one of the projects in this repository:

```python
import pandas as pd
from predictive_analytics.naive_bayes import MultinomialNaiveBayesModel

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('data/women_cloth_reviews.csv')
X = data['review_text']
y = data['sentiment']

# Initialize and train the model
model = MultinomialNaiveBayesModel()
model.train(X, y)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X)
print(predictions)
```
